### PRODUCTIVITY TIPS:
(_From discussion after our 12/13 Meetup:_)
* Do tutorials twice, forcing yourself to find a new solution on the second go-round!
* Set a schedule for when you're going to practice, and still to it!
* Try to break things! (Ex: tutorials, code you've forked)
* Use a Timesheet App to track the time you spend on projects(there are dozens to choose from)
* [Panda Planner!](https://pandaplanner.com/)
